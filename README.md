# weeknotes

Occasional updates from members of the UKCEH RSE team in weeknotes format

## What are "weeknotes"?

[Doing Weeknotes](https://www.doingweeknotes.com/) offers an excellent guide to weeknotes and how they typically work. From the introduction:

*Weeknotes are a format for regular communication about work in progress.*

*They act as a broadcast mechanism. They give teams and individuals a voice, and a platform for communicating with almost anyone, about the things that matter to both parties - weeknote writer and weeknote reader.*

*They’re called “weeknotes” because they are:

*    *usually written once a week, usually on a Friday*
*    *a reflection on the week that’s just ended - just that, nothing more*
*    *supposed to become a habit*
*   *deliberately rough notes, rather than structured prose or formal documentation.*
*    *quick to write, and quick to read*

## Why are we doing this?

When the RSE team within Environmental Data Science was first formed we starter writing weeknotes but this paradoxically became harder as the team grew.

We've recreated this as a repository, not in an effort to compose weekly progress reports but to provide a single point where team members can reflect and interested parties might get an answer to the question, "how do I stay engaged and informed?"
